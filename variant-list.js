        description: "An 8-player ktango variant where players are split into two teams, positive and negative, and play a total of 12 or 16 concurrent ktango games. Routers and execs of the games are chosen according to the rules of quaternion multiplication. Similar to Kt3-by-2ngo, but with 4 players on each team and router/exec pairs sometimes go across teams. Each player routes 3 other players, and is routed by 3 other players, while optionally also playing a lockout game. The team with more router victories across all games wins.",
